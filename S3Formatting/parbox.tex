Some very large random text that will not fit somewhere easily, it might be a table, it might be next to an equation.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline 
		Text & \parbox{.25\textwidth}{\centering Some very large random text that will not fit somewhere easily, it might be a table, it might be next to an equation.} \\\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Caption}
	\label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}

\begin{align*}
	\left.\begin{array}{c}
		x + y = 10\\
		x - y = 5
	\end{array}\right\} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{\parbox{5cm}{Some very large random text that will not fit somewhere easily, it might be a table, it might be next to an equation.}}
