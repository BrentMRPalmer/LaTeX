\section{Introduction}

If we want to underline a word or a sentence, we use the command \underline{underline}. On the other hand we might want to use bold fonts, and we do that by invoking the command \textbf{textbf}. Finally, the other very common way to put emphasis on a text is the use of italics, and for that we use the command \textit{textit}. \emph{emphasis} is also italics (depending on the documentclass), but not always.
